# python-snowfall


This is a program in python that uses turtles to make the illusion of snow falling from the sky. This was programmed in the Graphics Studio Class at Proof School in the fall of 2017. The snowfall part of the program works by creating turtles and storing them in a list that can be iterated through later for applying movement. The mountains are also turtles that have had their shape and size altered to look like mountains.

This was created using the IDLE editor and also VI on the terminal in Linux. If you are using VI to look at this program, I reccomend looking at VI options to turn on numbered lines.

If you are using IDLE, on a Mac you can press fn and F5 at the same time to run it. On a computer or pc with Windows, you can just press F5 to run it. When using Vi, a simple thing to do is to first go into terminal and then the directory that the program is in. Then type python3 missionSnowflake.py to run it and to stop it, close the Python Turtle Graphics window and press enter in the terminal.
