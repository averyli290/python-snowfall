# python-snowfall


This is a program in python that uses turtles to make the illusion of snow falling from the sky. This was programmed in the Graphics Studio Class at Proof School in the fall of 2017. The snowfall part of the program works by creating turtles and storing them in a list that can be iterated through later for applying movement. The mountains are also turtles that have had their shape and size altered to look like mountains.
